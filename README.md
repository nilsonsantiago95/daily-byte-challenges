## Presentation

This project is focused on tackling the programming logic challenges from Daily Byte. Each day, a new challenge is presented, starting from the simplest and gradually increasing in complexity.

My goal with this project is to enhance my problem-solving skills using algorithms and data structures, specifically in the Java language. I aim to become more familiar with the concepts and syntax of Java, continuously improving my programming abilities through these daily challenges.
